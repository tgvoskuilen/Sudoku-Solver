# Sudoku Solver

At this point, who hasn't made a Sudoku solver? The first one I made was a cobbled together Excel+Visual Basic version many years ago.

This solver has both a backtracking option and a rule-based solver (that falls back to guesses when the rules fail). The rule based solver is, on average, about 300x faster than the backtracking method.
